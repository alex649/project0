Project0

Created by Alex Spivakovsky

This application serves as an online ordering system for the 'Three Aces Pizza' restaurant.  
The index page of the website presents the user with a drop-down menu to choose the type of food
from the list of items (Pizzas, Salads, Grinders, etc.).  Upon making the selection,
the user arrives at the next page that presents the menu and prices for items of this particular food category.  
For example, if the user has chosen 'Pizzas' from the previous page, the next page presents a drop-down menu 
that contains items such as "Tomato & Cheese small $5.80" and "Tomato & Cheese large $9.75".  

Upon making a selection, the user arrives at the Shopping Cart that contains items, quantities, 
and prices that have been added to the cart.  The user has the option of changing item quantities, 
going back to the Welcome page to choose more food to buy, or to submit the order.

To obtain the menu of different items with prices for each food category, 
the application parses an XML file, project0/model/menu.xml.  In other words, every time the user visits 
the page project0/food.php, the program parses the xml file to obtain menu information.

The application complies with the Model-View-Controller architecture.  
In this particular application project0/index.php serves as the Controller for the application.
project0/model/functions.php contain appropriate functions for computing and displaying order totals.  
project0/model/menu.xml file is the database of the application, and project0/views contains code
for display.
